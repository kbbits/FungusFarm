# Fungus Farm
UnrealEngine 4.25

Crafting / Clicker - grow crops, produce products in workshop crafting devices.<br>
7 types of fungal crops, 8 types of workshop equipment<br>
70+ craftable recipes, 80+ goods to produce and collect, 16 craftable equipment mods<br>
120+ scripted narrative goals over 10+ hours of gameplay.<br>

## Gameplay
As the player grows more crops and produces more goods, they are introduced to the various spirit tribes.<br>
These spirit tribes provide goals for the player as they unlock new fungi, new equipment and master new recipes.<br>
Along the way, the player will construct and upgrade spirit totems for each of the tribes, further increasing their production.<br>
These goods and recipes are needed by the spirits as a deep trouble is brewing in the spirit realm.<br>

## Study Project
This project is part of my learning process and serves to demonstrate familiarity with various concecpts including:
* Cpp and Blueprint Actor Components (inventory, attributes, etc.)
* Cpp gameplay goal provider components with data-table-driven goals and goal templates, built with cpp interfaces
* Cpp and Blueprint custom Modifiable Attributes system, built around cpp interface, supporting actor-specific and world-global modifiers.
* Cpp and Blueprint Modifier Equipment with data-table definable properties: scalar and multiplier attribute modifiers; constant, duration and event-triggered activation
* Cpp function library for simplifying inventory goods management: add, subtract, multiply goods quantities; evaluation of goods drop chances to produced goods, etc.
